# Branding
These are the branding guidelines for the My-DAO-Dashboard styling.<br>
In these guidelines, following topics will be covered:

  * [Logo](#Logo)
  * [Typography](#Typography)
  * [Colours](#Colours)
  * [Iconography](#Iconography)

## <a id="Logo"></a> Logo

The My DAO Dashboard-logo is a visual reference to the radar of a dashboard and the letter D. It is ideally used as a standalone image. The title 'My DAO Dashboard' is added when so required to avoid confusion (e.g. in a sponsorship-context, on swag, on top of the app).

### Do's:
  * Give the logo enough space around it (visually 2/5)
  * Use the positive version on a light background
  * Use the negative version on a dark background
  * Only show the logo in the [brand colours](#Colours) 

### Don'ts:
  * Don't alter, rotate, skew, morph or transform the logo
  * Don't trim the space surrounding the logo
  * Donâ€™t accessorize the logo with extra elements
  



## <a id="Typography"></a> Typography

As a primary font, My-DAO-Dashboard uses ['Lato'](#https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) in weights 'bold' and 'light'. More t.b.d.
