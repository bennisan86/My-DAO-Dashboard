# My-DAO-Dashboard

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wslyvh/My-DAO-Dashboard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wslyvh/My-DAO-Dashboard)

## Introduction

You will soon be in a position where you are a voting member of more DAOs than you can possible manage.

MakerDAO
Aragon
Moloch DAO
metacartel DAO
Genesis DAO
dxDAO
...did I miss any big ones?

Also, things will soon get totally out of hand with the option to create new DAOs with Aragon or Colony or...

You will have a different stake in each DAO, different contracts, and there will come responsibilities that you must undertake as part of your involvement in each DAO (like votes).

It's going to get really messy really quickly.

## Idea description

Please, ETHBerlin, buidl me a dashboard where I can see some information about all the DAOs I'm participating in, based on my Ethereum address.
